# This is the Server Backend
Backend part of the **Inivisible Drawer Lock** project built for Robotics@Berkeley's Dorm Ex Machina (Dorm of the Machine) competition ***(Won Second Place! Yay)***. The server backend can handle requests from Arduino and message smartphone.

## What is Invisible Drawer Lock

An alerting device that can message your phone if someone opens your drawer without your permission. You need to put the hardware (Arduino plus Wifi, Bluetooth and sensor) in your drawer, and turn on the device with the Drawer Switch app on your Android phone after closing your drawer. Then just wait for any alerts about your roommate trying to sneak your snacks in the drawer!
